## Description

#### The goal of this project was to create an online portfolio webpage to showcase my current and future web development projects.

- The portfolio is presented with my name and a photo.
- The navigation bar contains links to sections within the page. When a link is clicked the page scrolls to the corresponding section.
- In the work section, when the images showing the projects are clicked, the user is taken to the deployed project website. Currently only a single project exists.
- The layout is responsive at various screen sizes.
the webpage uses semantic elements and contains alt texts for images.
